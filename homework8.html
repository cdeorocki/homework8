		<h2>Humble Beginnings</h2>
			<p> The first mascara was made using Vaseline and black ink. It has come a long way since then. Hundreds of new products have exploded on to the market with several different brands claiming that their formula will produce the "longest", "thickest" or "strongest" lashes. Here, at The Bionic Lash, we believe that a specific formula is not the best way to gain the perfect set of lashes.
			</p>
		<h2>What We Do</h2>
			<p>
				The Bionic Lash wants to introduce our newest product, the Lash Genome Supplement.Instead of applying coats of toxic ink and chemicals to your lash line, we have developed a revolutionary vitamin supplment that aids in the growth of the longest, thickest, and strongest lashes you could ever hope to have! These amazing lashes are actually possible, and you can grow them naturally, starting organically, from the inside.
